## About
Ovommand is a command parsing and handling framework for PocketMine-MP. It made it easy for defining, registering, and executing commands with complex parameter structures, validation, and hierarchical organization.<br>
### Features

## Getting Started




## Issues:
1. - [ ] `$returnRaw` in `BaseResult` is confusing and useless?
2. - [ ] `isBlockPos` current do nothing in CoordinateResult
3. - [ ] Allow users to decide how the subcommand aliases are handled (multiple overloads vs packed enum)
4. - [ ] Command namespace system (as vanilla addon) and duplicate command name.

TODO:
- [x] make reasonable enum that handle it value correctly (string -> value)
- [x] custom enum, parameters, enum-based parameters
- [x] feature rich
- [x] usage messages
- [x] result system (parser), not that good tho :l
- [ ] attribute supports (temp abandoned)
- [ ] SubCommand doesn't require perms if wanted
- [ ] ~~make syntax parser based on its string pos, not the string itself for the accuracy in catching broken syntax~~ spoiled
- [x] fix a bug where the parser cannot check the correct span leading to this to be valid: `/tp ~~~ a`, where a is not valid but the parser cannot know that because it don't expect that to be a case!
- [ ] fix broken SYNTAX_PRINT_VANILLA
- [ ] fix an issue where it failed to parse the parameter after position parameter that has less than the span! eg: ~~~ a, failed to parse a

Suggest:
- [x] make canParse and parse into one
- [x] empty parameter functionality
- [ ] allow parameter to not provide data to the ingame auto-complete
- [x] make overloadId global which will make the code shorter
- [ ] template? (temp abandoned)
- [ ] move part of Ovommand to BaseCommand
- [ ] do subCommand even need description?
- [x] more features to the syntax parser
- [ ] rename parsedId & matchedId in Results to rawParsedCount & parsedCount

Discuss:
- [ ] Default Enums should have its own register and a version checker!? (temp abandoned)
- [x] the problem with shared data is that if other plugins try to use other plugins enum... the enum might not exist due to plugin loading order!
- [x] Default enums can have duplicated values if the event called more than twice on different plugins!
- [ ] Merge onRun() and onSyntaxError()?
- [ ] Add supports for private enums and synced properties for soft enums

Self note:
- Soft enums cannot spread out its value using flag 1!
- Two enums, one soft and one hard could have a same name
- Enum name could be set to anything, not just ascii / UTF-8
