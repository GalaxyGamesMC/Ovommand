## ðŸ“– Introduction
Ovommand is a command parsing and handling framework for PocketMine-MP. It made it easy for defining, registering, and executing commands with complex parameter structures, validation, and hierarchical organization.<br>

### Features
1. - [x] Custom command with rich customizability
2. - [x] Custom subcommand/parameters with command enum supports
3. - [ ] Parser for complex parameters with syntax checker
   - - [x] Position parameter (`~~ ~`, `12 -31 ~123`, etc) - Done?
   - - [ ] Target parameter (`@a`, `@s`, etc...) - Currently unstable
   - - [x] Float, Int, Text,... parameter
   - - [ ] Json parameter
4. - [x] Default enums support (player list, gamemode, boolean, etc)
5. - [x] Visible/Hidden aliases for subcommands.
6. - [x] Constraints for commands
7. - [x] Auto-generated usage for commands/subcommands
8. - [ ] Command namespace (from vanilla addon: `/plugin1:test`)
9. - [ ] Duplicate command name handle (adding counter to the command name)
10. - [ ] Attribute supports (temp abandoned)
11. - [ ] ?
### Requirement
- PHP 8.2 or higher
- [PMMP](https://github.com//pmmp/PocketMine-MP) 5.27.0 or higher
- [simple-packet-handler](https://github.com/Muqsit/SimplePacketHandler) 0.1.5 or higher
## Getting Started
## Contributing
Yes, please...

## Note
### A. Namespace system
1) If plugin A has `namespace: ns` set in `plugin.yml` then <br>
a) plugin A has `force namespace`
<hr>

## Issues:
1. - [ ] `$returnRaw` in `BaseResult` is confusing and useless?
2. - [ ] `isBlockPos` current do nothing in CoordinateResult
3. - [ ] Allow users to decide how the subcommand aliases are handled (multiple overloads vs packed enum)
4. - [ ] Command namespace system (as vanilla addon) and duplicate command name.

TODO:
- [x] make reasonable enum that handle it value correctly (string -> value)
- [x] custom enum, parameters, enum-based parameters
- [x] feature rich
- [x] usage messages
- [x] result system (parser), not that good tho :l
- [ ] attribute supports (temp abandoned)
- [ ] SubCommand doesn't require perms if wanted
- [ ] ~~make syntax parser based on its string pos, not the string itself for the accuracy in catching broken syntax~~ spoiled
- [x] fix a bug where the parser cannot check the correct span leading to this to be valid: `/tp ~~~ a`, where a is not valid but the parser cannot know that because it don't expect that to be a case!
- [ ] fix broken SYNTAX_PRINT_VANILLA
- [ ] fix an issue where it failed to parse the parameter after position parameter that has less than the span! eg: ~~~ a, failed to parse a

Suggest:
- [x] make canParse and parse into one
- [x] empty parameter functionality
- [ ] allow parameter to not provide data to the ingame auto-complete
- [x] make overloadId global which will make the code shorter
- [ ] template? (temp abandoned)
- [ ] move part of Ovommand to BaseCommand
- [ ] do subCommand even need description?
- [x] more features to the syntax parser
- [ ] rename parsedId & matchedId in Results to rawParsedCount & parsedCount

Discuss:
- [ ] Default Enums should have its own register and a version checker!? (temp abandoned)
- [x] the problem with shared data is that if other plugins try to use other plugins enum... the enum might not exist due to plugin loading order!
- [x] Default enums can have duplicated values if the event called more than twice on different plugins!
- [ ] Merge onRun() and onSyntaxError()?
- [ ] Add supports for private enums and synced properties for soft enums

Self note:
- Soft enums cannot spread out its value using flag 1!
- Two enums, one soft and one hard could have a same name
- Enum name could be set to anything, not just ascii / UTF-8
