autocomplete:
all
group
/say
cmd:
/say all @target <text: string>
/say group <text: string>

->
* all and group is either sub cmd or enum, if enum but registered -> hard enum. Otherwise
* <text: string> is a parameter

/say

no such things as sub cmd? so to make it better, should sub cmd have another sub cmd?

27/08/2023:
an enum, <para name: enum name>!


/say all @target <text: string>
/say all me <text: string>
/say all you <text: string>
/say group <text: string>

-> say paras: [
    0 => sub cmd: all [
        0 => para: text
        1 => sub cmd: [

        ]
    ]
]

Commando lost its parenting!
