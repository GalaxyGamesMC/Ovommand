autocomplete:
all
group
/say
cmd:
/say all @target <text: string>
/say group <text: string>

->
* all and group is either sub cmd or enum, if enum but registered -> hard enum. Otherwise
* <text: string> is a parameter

/say

no such things as sub cmd? so to make it better, should sub cmd have another sub cmd?

an enum, <para name: enum name>!
